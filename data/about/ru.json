    "line1" : "What is Sophisticated Wolves? It's a mod that aims to improve wolves in the games through a series of gameplay tweaks, AI improvements, and added features. The focus is not to have overpowered items or crazy abilities, but rather balanced additions that make sense in the world of MC. Essentially, wolves should be able to better respond to your actions and take care of themselves, so you don't have to consider them a liability when mining, exploring or fighting.",
    "line2" : "This is an updated and reworked version of metroidfood's \"Sophisticated Wolves\" mod.",

        "line1" : "One of the most oft-requested features, names to differentiate between your pets. Craft a leather Dog Tag and you'll be able to give your pet a proper title (16 chars max). They behave like normal player nametags when standing but are not visible through walls when sitting.",
        "line2" : "Nameplates will also change color according to the health of your wolf. White = full health, and it gets progressively more red as a wolf's health goes down."

        "title" : "Breeding",
        "line1" : "No more accidental breeding, wolves now have a new item to get them in the mood. Feed two tamed wolves a Dog Treat made out of two wheat and a porkchop (raw or cooked) and they'll produce a puppy. Puppies are automatically tamed and will inherit a parent's breed."

        "title" : "Biome-Specific Wolves",
        "line1" : "Wolves' appearance will vary depending on the biome they spawn in. Taiga wolves are the classic gray, while forest wolves are light brown. You can also find black and dark brown wolves, but these colors are harder to find than their lighter counterparts."

        "line1" : "Crouching with Shift will make any wolves currently attacking a creature stand still and stop attacking. Holding down Shift for around 5 seconds will cancel their attack entirely, so they don't slaughter your flock of sheep because you accidentally punched them. Wolves will also lose interest in a target if you're far enough away from it when they teleport to you."

Change it in the config file, located in your .minecraft/config folder. You can also change the ID numbers of the items if you run into a conflict with other mods."
